# Knight's Tour Solver

This repository contains Python code for solving the Knight's Tour problem using a backtracking algorithm and visualizing the solution with Pygame. The Knight's Tour is a classic chess puzzle where the goal is to move a knight to every square on the chessboard exactly once.

## Contents

- `tour.py`: A Python script that implements the backtracking algorithm to find a Knight's Tour on an N x N chessboard.
- `tourPygame.py`: A Python script that uses Pygame to visualize the Knight's Tour found by the algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for visualization)

## Customization
You can modify the size of the chessboard in tour.py by changing the N variable.
The starting position of the knight can also be adjusted in the code.
